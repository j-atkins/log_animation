# log_animation

Custom schedule.yaml and and ship_config.yaml files for creating an example VirtualShip log animation (via screen recording and conversion to GIF).

Parameters are adjusted where the log runs through reasonably quickly (to fit in a short animation), rather than for any scientific/technical reasons.
